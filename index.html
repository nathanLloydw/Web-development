        <p>At my very core, I am a problem solver. It's what drives me, what keeps me up at night, and what gets me out of bed in the morning.
My programming journey started in 1984, at the ripe age of 7, learning Basic on an Apple IIe in first grade, and a Texas Instruments TI-99 at home.
Commodore 64 brought more Basic tinkering and my fascination with digital communications and the local Bulletin Board Systems. My Mother was very involved with a local Commodore user's group, and it would be wrong not to give her credit for fostering my budding curiosity with computers and programming.
In 2002, I finally realized my dream of working full-time in IT. What started as deskside support has morphed into Windows system administration. During 2003, I also landed my first paid developer job, writing electronic security software for a regional jail in Virginia.
I currently continue to work as a Windows systems administrator full-time which also includes serving as the facility's web developer. While systems administration brings new challenges daily, nothing inspires me like coding.
A very amateur photographer, having picked up the hobby in 2016 after many years of wanting to share how I see the world and all of it's beauty.
